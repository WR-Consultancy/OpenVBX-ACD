Stupid simple automatic call distributor with incoming call queue!

*Place in your OpenVBX plugin folder
*Drop the queue applet wherever you want it in your call flow
*Name your queue, choose some hold music and tell it what to do when no agents are accepting calls
*Tell your agents to use the Queue link under the new Calls menu and to set their status to Available when they are ready to receive calls
*You're done!

When a call comes in, it is routed to the first available agent or put on hold until an agent finishes their current call.
